# A simple Countdown Timer

To use, enter the number of minutes in the countdown box and then press start, the timer will begin immediately. 

While the timer is active you may pause/resume the countdown with the button next to the time remaining.

To restart the timer it must first be paused, then the restart button becomes available. This is to prevent accidental restarting of the timer while it is running. 

To change the speed of the timer use the slider, the effect takes place immediately.
